# WonkaBuild

## Web client for running and managing DevOps tasks

### Task
A task is the single unit that performs something meaningful. It could be to run a script, copy a directory, contact a web service or as simple as outputting a message to the console.

### Build Definition
A build starts with a definition. A build definition is a collection of tasks that can run sequentially or in parallel.

### Coded Build Tasks
For more complex scenarios that require existing or new executable binaries to be run, custom build tasks can be created.
This enables proprietory tasks to live in your own source code repository and through refelction can be added as part of the overall build.
